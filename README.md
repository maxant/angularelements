# What is this?

A proof of concept used to work out if there is a disadvantage of using web components (realised as angular elements) compared with importing components from a library. The results are in the readme of the angular14app folder.

See the individual readme files, in this order:

- angular12element - which is an app containing an angular element (web component)
- angular14app - an app with a dependency on the web component from the above project
- deployedapp - an abstratium simply used for deploying the prod built code to the cloud
